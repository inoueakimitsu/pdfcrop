# PDFCrop

PDFCrop is a PDF viewer designed for learning purposes. It provides functionality to generate and copy a PDF file containing only the currently displayed page and a few preceding pages to the clipboard. By pasting this into ChatGPT or similar tools, you can easily ask questions specific to the pages you're viewing.
